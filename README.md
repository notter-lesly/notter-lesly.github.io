# Welcome to my portfolio!

As you know, my name is Lesly and I am a frontend developer.

In this project I show a little about myself, what I work with, a little about my taste for design, the colors I like and also my aesthetics as a frontender.

I decided to make this portfolio with vue3, nuxt3, vite and typescript because they are the main technologies I work with and they are modern, safe and very fast.

Also, I decided to work with Vue composition api (configuration script) as it is cleaner, simpler and more succinct.

With Css I decided to use Sass because it facilitates some changes and allows me to create my variables and mixins simply and efficiently.
